# Project Configuration

We use the RON (Rusty Object Notation) for project configuration.

The RON format allows for human modifiable configuration file, that is easy to understand.
While it is similar to JSON in structure, it is much simpler.

Due to this simplicity and human readability we chose to use it over other formats like TOML, YAML or JSON.
These other formats start out as being human-readable, but quickly become an unreadable mess once more complex
functionality is needed.

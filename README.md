# Service-Helper

Service-Helper is a utility tool for local development with dependencies like Docker containers.

## Note about self-usage

This tool was written for my own use, so expect this tool to be highly opinionated.  
Also, it is my first rust program, so expect bugs, badly structured and un-optimized code.

Only Linux on AMD64 is supported and tested on.  
If you feel the need to port this tool to another platform, you can do so.  
When changes to the code are needed that are non-breaking for my use case, I would be happy
to merge those changes!

Do not expect me to provide any kind of support, and read the code before running the tool!

# This is a file we use to "version" the cache artifacts in Space Automation.
# Every time the automation runs, this file is hashed and based on that hash either
# an existent cache is loaded and used for compilation.
# Due to this, this file should only be modified when a new cache is needed.
# Such a situation may arise when dependencies or files changed a lot and
# compilation times become slow again.
